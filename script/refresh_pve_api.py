"""Refresh `schema/pve_api.json` from the Proxmox VE API schema.

The web interface's API viewer is driven by one file, `apidoc.js`, which
carries the whole API as JSON: every path, the methods it answers, the
parameters they take and the privileges they check. That is the only
machine-readable description Proxmox publishes, and it is what the
conformance test and the privilege map are built from.

Kept here are the facts a client needs - paths, methods, parameter names,
permission checks. The prose (descriptions, defaults, formats) is left
where it belongs, in the documentation the file comes from.

Run `python script/refresh_pve_api.py` after a Proxmox release and commit
what changes; the diff is then a readable list of what the API gained or
lost.

The extract carries a `_source` entry saying where it came from and when
the published file was last changed. `apidoc.js` itself names no version,
and the documentation site only lists past releases, so that timestamp is
the dependable answer to "is this still current": run the script, and it
says whether the published schema has moved since.
